# Website Analytics

Website Analytics is a command-line application that manages data relating to an organization's website performance.  The user can interact with the application by entering the daily website data.  The application processes the entered and historical data and provides the user with insights relating to website performance.

You can use the live application [here](https://website-analytics-reporting.herokuapp.com/).
